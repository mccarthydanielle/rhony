        Hi fellow Bravo-obsessed people. My name is Danielle McCarthy and I
        developed this website after experiencing a lack of motivation to build
        a personal portfolio website. I love reality tv and decided to build
        something I'm interested in. I hope you enjoy the site and would like to
        thank everyone who has contributed the mass amounts of data that is
        required to maintain a site like this. Feel free to email me or tweet me
        with any suggestions / ideas for the site. Cheers.{' '}
