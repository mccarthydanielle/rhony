      <p>Hi fellow Bravo-obsessed people. My name is Danielle McCarthy and I developed this website after experiencing a lack of motivation to build a personal portfolio website. I love reality tv and decided to build something I'm interested in. I hope you enjoy the site and would like to thank everyone who has contributed the mass amounts of data that is required to maintain a site like this. Feel free to email me or tweet me with any suggestions / ideas for the site. Cheers.  </p>
